Version Control System:

Version Control System is basically just a method of system tracking changes in a file or a bunch of files over a period of time.
- Git helps in keeping track of code changes
- Also used to collaborate on code


Input Command starts with $

Github is a Remote repository platform

Commands:
- To check version - git —version
- To initialise git - git init
- To let Git know who you are are git —config global user.name “Reema Jha” and git —config global user.email “reema199724@gmail.com”
- By using Global in the above command we have set the user name and email for every repository on the computer. Remove global if you want use it only for the current repo
- mkdir (makes a new directory) and cd (changes the current working directory)
- cd (select the path of the folder or repository you want to work on)
- Git init (initialise the git) this will create a git repository (.git)
- On any text editor, create a HTML file and write something in it. To open it through Git open (filename)
- ls (list the files in the directory)
- Git status (to track the status of the file)

Files in your Git repository folder can be in one of 2 states:
* Tracked - files that Git knows about and are added to the repository
* Untracked - files that are in your working directory, but not added to the repository
 When you first add files to an empty repository, they are all untracked. To get Git to track them, you need to stage them, or add them to the staging environment.

Git Staging Environment: 

After we finish a part of work, it’s important to add the files in the Staging environment.

- Git add (file name)
