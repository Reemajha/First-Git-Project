Git Branch

Branches allow you to work on different parts of a project without impacting the main branch. When the work is complete, a branch can be merged with the main project. You can even switch between branches and work on different projects without them interfering with each other.

- git branch hello-world-images
- git branch (to check where are we right now, on master or on the branch that we created
- git checkout hello-world-images (To change the location to the branch that we created)
