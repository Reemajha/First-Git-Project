Git and Github

- git remote add origin (url)
- git push â€”set-upstream origin master

Git Pull from Github

Pull is a combination of two commands:
- Fetch
- Merge

To get all the change history of the origin for a branch
- git fetch origin

Merge the current branch with the branch master, on origin:
- git merge origin/master

Update the current branch from its origin using a single command
- git pull origin

push the current branch to its default remote origin
- git push origin

PULL BRANCH FROM GITHUB TO LOCAL Git

- git pull (to keep our code up-to-date)
- git status
- git branch -a (to see all local and remote branches)
- git branch -r (to see only remote branches)
- git checkout html-skeleton
- git pull (to see if is all up to date)


PUSH BRANCH TO GITHUB

- git checkout -b update.readme
- git status
- git add README.md
- git commit -m "Updated README for Github Branches"
- git push origin update.readme


The GitHub flow works like this:

1) Create a new Branch
2) Make changes and add Commits - add the changes to your branch by commit.
3) Open a Pull Request -A Pull Request notifies people you have changes ready
for them to consider or review.You can ask others to review your changes or
pull your contribution and merge it into their branch.
4) Review
5) Deploy - GitHub allows you to deploy from a branch for final testing in
production before merging with the master branch.
6) Merge

Note: commit messages are very important! Let everyone know what has changed
and why. Messages and comments make it so much easier for yourself and other
people to keep track of changes.
Note: GitHub shows new commit and feedback in the "unified Pull Request view".
Note: You can add keywords to your pull request for easier searching!

GIT GITHUB PAGES
- On github create a new repository
- name it Reemajha.github.io (Username.github.io)
- Copy the link and git remote add gh-page url
- Go to the master branch
- git push gh-page master
- In settings, go to pages, and click on the URL


FORK A REPOSITORY

A fork is a copy of a repository. This is useful when you want to contribute to
someone else's project or start your own project based on theirs.

CLONE A FORK FROM GITHUB

A clone is a full copy of a repository, including all logging and versions of
files.

- git clone (URL)

Now, we have full copy of the repository but we are not allowed to make
changes to it.
- git remote -v
- git remote rename origin upstream
- git remote add origin (URL of our own fork)
- git remote -v

Note: To specify a specific folder to clone to, add the name of the folder after
 the repository URL, like this: git clone
 https://github.com/w3schools-test/w3schools-test.github.io.git myfolder

 Note: According to Git naming conventions, it is recommended to name your own
 repository origin, and the one you forked for upstream

Now we have 2 remotes:

origin - our own fork, where we have read and write access
upstream - the original, where we have read-only access
