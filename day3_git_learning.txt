GIT IGNORE

When sharing your code with others, there are often files or parts of your project, you do not want to share.

Examples

log files
temporary files
hidden files
personal files

However, the .gitignore file itself IS tracked by Git.

- touch .gitignore

In .gitignore add a line to ignore all .temp files:
- *.temp

In .gitignore add a line to ignore all files in any directory named temp:
- temp/

In .gitignore add a single line to ignore all files named temp1.log, temp2.log, and temp3.log:
- temp?.log

In .gitignore, ignore all .log files, except main.log:
*.log
!main.log

GIT SECURITY SSH

SSH is a secure shell network protocol that is used for network management,
remote file transfer, and remote system access.

SSH uses a pair of SSH keys to establish an authenticated and encrypted secure
network protocol. It allows for secure remote communication on unsecured open
networks.

SSH keys are used to initiate a secure "handshake". When generating a set of
keys, we generate a "public" and "private" key.

The "public" key is the one you share with the remote party.
Think of this more as the lock.

The "private" key is the one you keep for yourself in a secure place.
Think of this as the key to the lock.

SSH keys are generated through a security algorithm. It is all very complicated,
 but it uses prime numbers, and large random numbers to make the public and
 private key.

It is created so that the public key can be derived from the private key,
but not the other way around.
